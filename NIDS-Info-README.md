Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are security solutions designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats. They analyze packets traversing the network, looking for patterns that may indicate malicious behavior, policy violations, or unauthorized access attempts. NIDS can use various detection methods, including:

- **Signature-based detection:** Compares network traffic against a database of known attack patterns.
- **Anomaly-based detection:** Uses machine learning or statistical models to identify deviations from normal network behavior.
- **Hybrid approaches:** Combine both signature and anomaly-based techniques for improved accuracy.

Modern NIDS often leverage artificial intelligence and deep learning to enhance detection capabilities, reduce false positives, and adapt to evolving threats. They play a crucial role in layered security architectures, providing real-time alerts and supporting incident response efforts.
